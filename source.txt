Endorphins contracted from endogenous morphinenot are e dogenous opioid neuropeptides and peptide hormones in humans and other animals. They are produced by the central nervous system and the pituitary gland. The term endorphins implies a pharmacological activity analogous to the activity of the corticosteroid category of biochemicals as opposed to a specific chemical formulation. It consists of two parts: endo- and -orphin; these are short forms of the words endogenous and morphine, intended to mean a morphine-like substance originating from within the body The class of endorphins includes three compounds—alpha-endorphin alpha-endorphins, beta-endorphin beta endorphins, and gamma-endorphin gamma ndorphins—which preferentially bind to mu-opioid receptors  The principal function of endorphins is to inhibit the communication of pain signals; they may also produce a feeling of euphoria very similar to that produced by other opioids
